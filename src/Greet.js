// Your custom components should start with a capital letter.

// #1 Import React
import React from 'react';
// If we were doing Node, we would have written
// const React = require('react');

// #3 Declare your component
function Greet() {
    
}











// #2 Export your component
export default Greet; // Make the component name match the file name. 
// By 'default', if someone imports from Greet.js, they should
// receive our Greet component.
